# Wind-Energy-Work-Learn

This repository contains a good amount of the work I did during my work learn at UBC's Earthquake Engineering Research Facility. In particular it contains:

Inverse design procedure of wind turbine using WISDEM, WEIS, ROSCO, and OpenFAST.

Different simulation set ups I used for OpenFAST along with code to run it through MATLAB. Mainly full simulations and linearization studies in OpenFAST

Some modelling of Rotor Anisotropy, in particular modelling whirling modes in Campbel diagram

OpenFAST external platform model which uses a linearized Gazetas foundation model along with "Earthquake" inputs
